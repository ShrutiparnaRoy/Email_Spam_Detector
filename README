Email Spam Detection
The best-performing spam detection model was Naïve Bayes, achieving 100% precision and 97.19% accuracy using TF-IDF with max_features=3000. While ETC and RF showed high accuracy, they didn't reach perfect precision. KNN also had 100% precision but lower accuracy. Naïve Bayes offers an optimal balance for effective spam classification.
